KiteLogger
----------
I wanted to fly a kite with a camera and some sensors attached to it.
Just a small app to record the camera and sensor data at the same time.
(Currently the camera part doesn't really work. Please let me know if you can fix it.
The caveat is that I have to target API Level 7.)

Let me know what you use it for -- I'd love to know!
